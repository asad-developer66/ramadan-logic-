# Ramadan Logic

This project calculates the remaining time until the upcoming Ramadan in **days, weeks, and months** using JavaScript.

## Files

- `index.html` → Basic HTML page to run the JavaScript code.
- `app.js` → JavaScript logic for calculating days, weeks, and months remaining.

## How it works

1. `app.js` gets the current date using JavaScript `Date` object.
2. Calculates the difference between the upcoming Ramadan date and today.
3. Converts the difference from milliseconds to days, weeks, and months.
4. Displays the results in the console.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Check the console to see the remaining time until Ramadan.
